This firmware allows you to to use Playstation 1 and 2 controllers on a Nintendo 64 console. It was implemented in the microcontroller PIC16F688 from Microchips, but it can probably be ported with minimum effort to other mid-range PICs.

## Features:

* Great gaming experience!
* 100% assembly code for low latency: 200us to 1.5ms.
* Analog stick with corrected range (~63%), and deadzone of 7% (can be changed before flashing). This configuration allows very high precision to let you play any N64 game with ease.
* Buttons are not hardcoded - user can have configure until 3 button presets before flashing. The button mapping can be changed during game directly from the controller.
* Works with genuine Dual-Shock and Dual-Shock 2 controllers (not tested with 3rd party ones).
* Hardware very simple to build - all the hard stuff is done in software.
